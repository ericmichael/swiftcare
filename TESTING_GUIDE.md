# The 37signals Guide to Rails Testing

## 1.0 Core Philosophy [CORE-PHIL]
The 37signals testing approach emphasizes testing through real interfaces over isolated units, favoring simplicity and business value over comprehensive coverage. The majority of testing happens through controller tests, with minimal unit tests and very focused system tests for smoke testing critical paths.

## 2.0 General Principles [GEN-PRIN]

### 2.1 Test Through HTTP When Possible [PRIN-HTTP]
- 2.1.1 Controller tests are your primary testing layer
- 2.1.2 Use real objects and database interactions
- 2.1.3 Avoid mocks and stubs
- 2.1.4 Test the application as users will experience it

### 2.2 Focus on Business Value [PRIN-VALUE]
- 2.2.1 Test behavior that matters to users and the business
- 2.2.2 Skip testing Rails defaults and basic functionality
- 2.2.3 Don't aim for 100% test coverage
- 2.2.4 Write tests that provide confidence, not compliance

### 2.3 Keep Tests Simple [PRIN-SIMPLE]
- 2.3.1 Avoid complex test helpers and abstractions
- 2.3.2 Use fixtures over factories
- 2.3.3 Keep setup minimal
- 2.3.4 Make test intentions clear through naming

## 3.0 Controller Tests (Primary Testing Layer) [CTRL-TEST]

## 11.0 Conclusion [CONCLUSION]

This testing approach emphasizes pragmatism over perfectionism, focusing on tests that provide real value to your application. The key points are:
- [CON-1] Controller tests are your primary testing layer
- [CON-2] Unit tests are only for complex business logic
- [CON-3] System tests are for smoke testing critical paths
- [CON-4] Use real objects over mocks/stubs
- [CON-5] Keep things simple and focused

Remember: The goal is not to test everything, but to test the right things at the right level, with an emphasis on testing through HTTP.
